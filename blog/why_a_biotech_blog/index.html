                    <p>Back when I was first starting on my adventures in software, there was so much to learn. Even with the copious resources available, I still found it difficult to wrap my head around concepts that people were writing about. I felt like if someone could frame the problem for me correctly - and sometimes someone would - then I would have been able to learn things much faster. This will be a blog about my adventures into biology. It is meant to be a practical guide to building and editing the substrate of which we are an outgrowth.</p>

<p>This blog will also serve as my own reference for the things that I learn along the way. I&rsquo;d like to get to a point where I am able to run through the full design, build, test, learn phase repeatedly with my own equipment. My introduction to biology was an excellent lecture series from The Great Courses called <em>Biology: The Science of Life</em>. I didn&rsquo;t follow everything that was talked about, but it definitely sparked my interest. Thanks to all the people responsible for making that happen, especially to Stephen Nowicki.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently become somewhat obsessed with synthetic biology in a way that I haven&rsquo;t been since I first started learning to program computers. The idea of programming life; that we can shortcut natural processes is very compelling. Synthetic biology allows us to make spider silk from yeast, gasoline from algae, and insulin from bacteria.</p>

<p>If you find any errors in my posts, please contact me to help me out.</p>

<p>I hope that someone in the future finds this useful.</p>
